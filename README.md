Banking is a study project for using sqlite DB with python. 

It can determine using Luhn's algorithm is a card number valid or not.

Also it can do some basic operations:
1. Create account
2. Balance
3. Add income
4. Do transfer
5. Close account
6. Log out

It needs [rstr](https://pypi.org/project/rstr/) for a xeger() method wich was inspired by the Java library of the same name.

The xeger() method allows users to create a random string from a regular expression.
